# Reports

## Purpose

This document describes the **statistical reports** generated stimulus matching between conditions (**CON** vs. **ABS**).

All outputs are generated by 02_stimuli_statistics.ipynb and saved in stimuli_selection/reports/.

---

## Variables analysed

Stimulus sets are compared on the following variables:

* number of characters (`nchar`),
* number of syllables (`syllables`),
* lexical frequency (Zipf scale),
* concreteness ratings (used for condition definition).

---

## Statistical tests used

The following tests are applied **only for diagnostic purposes** during stimulus selection:

### Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (two-sample)

* **Function:** `scipy.stats.ks_2samp`
* **Purpose:** assess distributional similarity between CON and ABS
* **Applied to:** `nchar`, `syllables`, `zipf`

### Levene’s test (median-centered)

* **Function:** `scipy.stats.levene(center="median")`
* **Purpose:** assess variance homogeneity between conditions
* **Applied to:** `nchar`, `syllables`, `zipf`

### Composite mismatch score

* Combination of KS and Levene p-values (log-transformed)
* Used internally to rank candidate pairings during greedy matching
* Not interpreted as an inferential statistic
